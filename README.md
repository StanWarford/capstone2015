## Cross-Platform Push Notification Library
	All of the methods used to subscribe users and send push notifications to users come from the Smile-SA node-pushserver project, which can be found here: https://github.com/Smile-SA/node-pushserver
	The only changes one would generally make to this code would be to config.json, which contains the the mongoDB URL, and project information for iOS and Android projects so the server can send push notifications. Other than that, the methods from this project were used as-is.
